# Assignment II for the Stochastic Simulation course on the UvA

This folder contains the two python scripts which can be used to simulate multiple queuing systems such as M/M/c, M/D/c and M/H/c. 

The des_sim.py script is the main file to create .csv datafiles such as found in the data folder. Using these files it is possible to make graphs or do statistical tests. The code which can be used to make these plots is present in the data_analysis.py file.
